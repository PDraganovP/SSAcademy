                SCHRÖDINGER, Erwin <br>
                Austrian physicist <br>

            <p>
                Schrödinger, the only son of
                prosperous factory owner, was taught at home as a youngster. He then attended the
                University of Vienna and obtained his Ph.D. in 1910. In World War I he served as
                an artillery officer on the southwest front. More fortunate than Moseley [1121],
                he survived unharmed. In 1918 he made up his mind to abandon physics for philosophy,
                but the city in which he had hoped to obtain a university post was lost to Austria
                in the peace treaties. Schrödinger therefore remained a physicist.

                    In 1933 Schrödinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on wave
                    mechanics, sharing it with Dirac.
                </p>
                <p>In 1928 Schrödinger had succeeded Max Planck as professor of theoretical physics at
                    the University of Berlin, but in the same year that he earned the Nobel Prize,
                    Hitler came to power. Schrödinger did not wish to remain, and left for his native Austria.
                    Although not threatened) he made no secret of his detestation of the Nazis and their antiSemitic
                    policy. He once interfered with storm troopers bent on a pogrom. He nearly got himself killed
                    for his pains. <span id="read-less">Read less</span>
