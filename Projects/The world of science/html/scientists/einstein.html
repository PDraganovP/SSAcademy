            <p>
                Einstein was the son of a chemical engineer. Although Jewish, Einstein received his earliest
                education in a Catholic grammar school in Munich, Bavaria, to which city his family moved
                while he was still quite young. Like Newton [231], with whom he is often compared (and certainly
                he is the only scientist since Newton’s time who can bear the comparison), he showed no particular
                intellectual promise as a youngster. As a matter of fact, he was so slow in learning to speak
                that by the time he was three there was some feeling that he might prove retarded.

                    In 1894 his father (who had failed in business) left for Milan, Italy, while Albert stayed behind
                    to finish his high school studies. However, he did very badly in Latin and Greek and was interested
                    only in mathematics, so he left school by invitation of the teacher who said, “You will never
                    amount to anything, Einstein.” The young man thus became the most unusual dropout in the history
                    of science. His uncle, Jakob, another engineer, then began giving him mathematical puzzles that
                    continued to feed his interest in this direction.

                    In the special theory of relativity, Einstein worked out an interrelationship of mass and energy in
                    a famous equation that goes: E=mc2, where E is energy, m mass, and c the velocity of light. Since
                    the velocity of light is a huge quantity, a small amount of mass (multiplied by the square of the
                    velocity) is equivalent to a large amount of energy. <span id="read-less">Read less</span>
