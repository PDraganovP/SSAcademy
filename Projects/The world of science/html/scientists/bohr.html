            <p>
                Bohr, the son of a physiology professor, entered the University of Copenhagen in 1903,
                where he studied physics and was also a crackerjack soccer player. (His younger brother
                was even better and made the 1908 Danish Olympic soccer team, which took a second place.)

                Bohr received his doctorate there in 1911. The next year, he obtained a grant to travel
                abroad in order to further his education and went at once to Cambridge, where he worked
                under J. J. Thomson [869], and then to Manchester, where he worked under Ernest Rutherford [996],
                He married in 1912 (and eventually had five sons) and in 1916 he returned to the University of
                Copenhagen as professor of physics. <span id="read-more">Read more</span>

                    Rutherford had put forth the notion of the nuclear atom; that is, of an atom containing a tiny
                    massive nucleus at its center with a cloud of light electrons located on the periphery. It seemed to
                    Bohr, while yet at Cambridge, that if this internal structure of the atom were combined with the
                    quantum
                    theory put out by Planck [887] a little over a decade before, then perhaps it would be possible to
                    explain how substances emitted and absorbed radiant energy. This absorption and emission was of
                    vital
                    importance in spectroscopy for it accounted for the spectral lines that had been discovered
                    by Fraunhofer [450] a century earlier and put to use by Kirchhoff [648] a half century after that.
                    Through all the past century, however, scientists had been content to measure the position of the
                    lines without attempting to explain why a line should be located in one place rather than another.

                    Bohr labored unremittingly on behalf of the development of peaceful uses of atomic energy,
                    organizing the first Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1955. In 1957 he was awarded
                    the first Atoms for Peace award. <span id="read-less">Read less</span>
